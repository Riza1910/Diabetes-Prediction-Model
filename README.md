# Diabetes Prediction Model

Over a large section of people in India which is approximately 30 million people are suffering from
different types of Diabetes.This can be properly treated if known earlier.This project aims to assess the
risk of diabetes among individuals based on their other body parameters.The risk of having diabetes is
being predicted by using different machine learning models as these models give accurate results and thus
is essential in medical field.Here the model SVM(Support Vector Machine) is found to be the most
accurate among other models.

We have chosen the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database available on kaggle.

## Proposed Methodology

This project makes methodical attempts to design a system that forecasts the development of diabetes. In this project, three
machine learning algorithms namely logistic regression, K- nearest neighbors and supply vector machine.
These algorithms were applied on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. Experimental results determine the
adequacy of the designed system with an achieved accuracy of 78 percent using Supply Vector Machine
algorithm.
